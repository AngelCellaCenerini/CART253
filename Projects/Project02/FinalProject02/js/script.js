- MADELEINE -

A pictorial journey throughout one's unconsciousness.

The program develops into five levels, each guarding hidden enigmas. The User can either
survive the challenge or solve the puzzle and surpass the level, thus achieving a collectable item (either a Voice or a Script Shred).
Depending on how well the User performs, in the end they will be able to play a melody, concluding this experience.

Further technical and conceptual details are provided in the README.md file.
